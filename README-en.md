# Important Notice

The waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan-GUI-Edition has been ported to the .NET 5.0 version.  
Therefore, this C++ version will no longer be supported.  
Please use the [ported version](https://github.com/XyLe-GBP/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan-GUI-Edition-Reloaded) from now on.  
You can continue to use this version as well.  
Please note that we will not be able to provide support in case of any problems.

## Download

[Release](https://github.com/XyLe-GBP/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan-GUI/releases)

---

## Description

The following redistribution package must be installed in order to run this application.

[Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe)

If you have not installed it yet, please download it from above and install it on your PC.

If you do not want to install the redistribution package, you can start the program by manually placing the following DLLs in C:/Windows/System32/ or in the same directory as the EXE.

At least <code>MSVCP140.DLL</code>, <code>VCRUNTIME140.DLL</code>, and <code>MFC140U.DLL</code> are required.

(*Not required for v1.3 or earlier versions)

As a reminder, waifu2x uses the GPU to do the upscaling. Although processing is possible with the built-in graphics, using the GPU allows for faster conversion.

If you want to convert a video, you need to split the frame before upscaling, which takes a lot of time.

Image upscaling is the main focus, but video upscaling is also possible.  
See the comparison video below.  

[Upscaling comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/hU3T_Gu3Ehk)

When upscaling video, first use FFmpeg to perform frame splitting.  
When you do this, it puts a very large load on your PC.  
If you have a low-spec PC, it may take a very long time.  

Basically, the time taken for upscaling is proportional to the time and resolution of the video that is the target of upscaling.  
This means that upscaling a video with a long duration and relatively high resolution will take a long time.  

However, if your PC is equipped with a powerful GPU, this process can be shortened.  
Upscaling speed is highly dependent on the performance of the GPU.  
The higher the performance of the GPU, the faster the upscaling speed will be.  
We do not recommend using the CPU's built-in graphics (iGPU), but that does not mean it cannot be converted.
However, if you use the built-in graphics, it may take a lot of time.
For this reason, NVIDIA or AMD (RADEON) GPUs are recommended.
